Basic Rule of Thumb:
	All side effects are discarded, unless specified by the user.

Global Policy:

1. Changes to globals in workers are discarded by default.

2. Users can declared globals as mergeable by annotating them.
	- Mergeable: This object has to be merged with its counterpart in worker
	    thread at join time.

3. Objects from the std library will have the following default mergeable traits:
	- All objects will be replaced with the worker's version.

4. Users can specify the merge method of an object.

5. Annotations work only downwards, not upwards. In other words, only parents
     can specify annotations, children only inherit it.
